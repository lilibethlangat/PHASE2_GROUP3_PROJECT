    "## INTRODUCTION\n",
    "This project focuses on analyzing movie performance in the Entertainment and Media Sector to uncover patterns, trends and key drivers of commercial and critical success in the film industry. Since a single hit movie can make or break a studio's profits, the project will rely on structured data lusing variables such as release year, title, genre, production budget, worldwide revenue, audience rating and contributor roles (Directors and Writers) to guide smarter data driven decisions.Our insights help drive key areas like content strategy, budgeting and talent planning by revealing how different production choices influence both profits and ratings.\n",

    "It is very tricky and uncertain to predict a movie's success, hence, hard for Studios to make smart decisions. Key areas they struggle with are talent evaluation, budgeting and strategic planning. Inadequate and unclear data often leads to misallocating production budgets, misjudging audience preferences and overlooking high impact talent which leads to poor performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to provide clear insights that will help studios make smarter choices especially in investing, hiring and marketing. There is  need to build  a data driven model to help understand what makes a movie successful by combining multiple datasets which goes through cleaning, exploration and modelling. The analysis will majorly focus on identifying the high impact contributors (Directors/Writers) by analyzing their track record, quantifying the relationship between budget, revenue and profitability and determining the performance influence of genre, audience ratings and movie length. This is aimed at coming up with a set of actionable insights and recommendations designed to improve strategic decision making across film investment, talent selection and marketing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will translate complex movie performance data into strategic, actionable intelligence. The findings will support improvements in Studio investment strategies, talent scouting and collaboration planning, genre specific budgeting and forecasting, audience targeting and runtime optimization"

    "## Business Problem\n",
    "Despite the rapid evolution of filmaking technologies and global distribution platforms, many films still fail to achieve commercial success. Studios, distributors and investtors lack a clear, data driven understanding of which factors such as genre, budget, runtime and contributors consistently influence a movie's performance. This gap in insight risks misallocating production budgets, misjudging audience preferences and overlooking high impact talent."

    "## Objectives\n",
    "This project, therefore, aims to identify trends in movie success across runtime, genre, and contributor roles. It will assess which directors and writers are most consistently associated with high ratings and strong box office returns, evaluate how budget levels correlate with profitability, and explore how genre and runtime affect audience reception. The analysis will also highlight outliers and underperformers to inform future investment and marketing strategies.\n",
    "The goal is to deliver actionable insights that can improve studio decision-making, talent acquisition, and content planning. Success will be measured by the clear identification of high-performing contributors and genres, creation of intuitive visualizations that reveal performance trends, adoption of findings by strategic teams, and potential long-term improvements in production ROI and audience engagement."

    "# Data Understanding\n",
    "The datasets used in this project are sourced from publicly available movie databases, including Box Office Mojo (BOM), The Numbers (TN), and The Movie Database (TMDb). Together, they provide structured information on thousands of films released over the past two decades. The data includes a rich mix of financial, creative, and audience-related attributes, enabling a comprehensive analysis of film performance and contributor impact.\n",
    "The key variables include; release year, runtime, production budget, worldwide gross, revenue, director, writer, genre, average rating (vote_average), vote count, movie title. \n",
    "The data spans multiple formats; categorical variables such as genre, director, writer, and language, numerical variables such as budget, gross revenue, and ratings and temporal variables such as release year and runtime.\n"
